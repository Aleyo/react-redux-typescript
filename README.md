# React + Redux + TypeScript Bootcamp

This example application is here to teach new Applifters how to write modern WebApps and how to become awesome Front-End engineer.

This example app demonstrates the following technologies:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Framework for structuring your application as a set of components and then rendering them in the browser. Created by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - Framework for managing the state of your application
* [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) - A routing for react. *(Routing == what component is displayed when the URL in your browser addressbar changes)*
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Better JavaScript, with types and transpile-time checking. Invented by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - Better package manager than NPM 😉. Again, by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) - Packaging/Transpiling your source code. It translates from the languages that maximise developer happines (TypeScript, SASS, LESS) to languages that browser can understand (minified JavaScript, CSS).
